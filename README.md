# Pix2Pix GAN

Pix2Pix GAN for paired image-to-image translation to convert building facades to real buildings.

Unlike more basic GAN architectures that take in an noise vector as input to the generator, Pix2Pix takes in an image.

## Scope/Intent
Adapted from TensorFlow's Pix2Pix tutorial notebook. Intent is to better understand the network architecture behind Pix2Pix model.

## Built With
- TensorFlow

## Results

After training, we can see the input image, ground truth, and predicted image generated by the model.
